# Laplacian-Operator
This code implements Laplacian operators and its improvisation. This code is implemented in C++ using the OpenMesh Library [http://www.openmesh.org/]
The following are implemented:
- Uniform Laplace
- Laplace-Beltrami operator
- Explicit Laplacian Smoothing
- Implicit Laplacian Smoothing

Additionally, this code offers the option of adding zero-mean gaussian noise to the mesh to test the output. And the meshes can be color-coded to visualize the curvature changes.
